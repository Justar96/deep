## Project Architecture

This is a **Deep AI agent** monorepo built around the OpenAI Responses API for multi-turn agentic conversations. The project follows GPT-5 best practices and maintains comprehensive documentation for OpenAI integrations.

### âœ… **PRODUCTION STATUS: SPRINT 2 COMPLETE + PERFECT TEST SUITE**

The Deep agent has completed **Sprint 2: Enhanced Tool System** and achieved **PERFECT TEST COMPLETION** with comprehensive architecture standardization. The project now features a clean monorepo structure, standardized configurations, and production-ready build systems alongside sophisticated tool confirmation workflows and enterprise-grade capabilities.

**Latest Achievements:**
- âœ… **Architecture Standardization**: Transformed from nested structure to clean flat monorepo following best practices
- âœ… **Sprint 1**: Advanced Conversation Management with intelligent compression and memory optimization
- âœ… **Sprint 2**: Enhanced Tool System with confirmation workflows, risk assessment, and audit trails
- âœ… **PERFECT TEST SUITE**: 297/297 tests passing (100% success rate) with zero errors or warnings
- âœ… **Enterprise Security**: Tool confirmation system with risk-based approval workflows
- âœ… **Production Safety**: Emergency stops, impact analysis, and comprehensive audit logging
- âœ… **Quality Assurance**: Bulletproof testing framework with comprehensive validation
- âœ… **Cross-Platform**: Windows/Unix compatibility with standardized build scripts

### Core Architecture

### API Strategy: Responses API First

This project uses **OpenAI Responses API over Chat Completions** for GPT-5, following patterns documented in `docs/openai/migrate-to-responses-api.md`. The Responses API provides better reasoning persistence, improved tool calling, and cleaner semantics for agentic workflows.

- `npm run dev list` - List all conversation history
- `npm run dev clear [id]` - Clear specific conversation or all conversations
- `npm run dev config` - Display current configuration

### Advanced Usage Examples
```bash
# Interactive chat with GPT-5 features
npm run dev chat --model gpt-5 --verbosity high --reasoning medium

# Complex agentic request with function calling

## Development Notes

### ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: Regression Testing & Quality Assurance**

**ALWAYS follow this process when implementing new features or editing core systems:**

1. **Pre-Implementation Analysis**
   - Run comprehensive test suite: `npm run test` to establish baseline (297 tests)
   - Document current system behavior and performance metrics
   - Identify potential impact areas and dependencies
   - Verify current test coverage levels (100% success rate maintained)

2. **Post-Implementation Validation**
   - Run full test suite again and compare results (297 tests with 100% pass rate expected)
   - **MANDATORY**: Use the bug-hunter-reviewer agent to audit all changes
   - Check for performance regressions with load testing
   - Validate all existing functionality still works as expected
   - Ensure perfect test success rate is maintained

3. **Bug-Hunter-Reviewer Agent Usage**
   - Use the bug-hunter-reviewer agent after ANY significant code changes
   - Provide the agent with context about what was changed and why
   - Include relevant documentation from workspace and internet research
   - Address ALL issues identified by the bug-hunter before considering work complete

4. **Documentation Audit**
   - Cross-reference changes against project documentation
   - Verify compliance with established patterns and architectural decisions
   - Update documentation if new patterns or breaking changes are introduced
   - Validate against OpenAI API documentation and best practices

### Core Patterns
- Always use the Responses API pattern shown in the core types
- Follow the established event streaming architecture in `DeepEvent` types (now includes 7 new tool events)
- Configuration changes should update both `config.ts` and the Zod schema
- New tools must be registered through the `ToolRegistry` with proper risk assessment
- Conversation persistence follows the enhanced `ConversationState` interface with metrics and health tracking
- Use conversation-level locking for concurrent access to prevent race conditions
- Implement proper resource cleanup for tiktoken encoders and conversation locks
- Follow batch processing patterns for memory-intensive operations
- **NEW**: Tool operations require risk assessment and appropriate confirmation workflows
- **NEW**: All tool executions must be logged through the audit trail system
- **NEW**: Emergency stop capability must be respected by all tool implementations

### Function Calling Implementation
- Use `item.arguments` (not `item.input`) for OpenAI Responses API function calls
- Tool results use `function_call_output` type with proper `call_id` matching
- Avoid duplicate function call IDs by not adding `response.output` twice in follow-up requests

### Streaming Architecture
- `processResponse` method must be async generator to properly yield events
- Use `yield*` for delegating to nested generators
- Core event types: `turn_start`, `response_start`, `content_delta`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `turn_complete`
- **NEW Tool Events**: `tool_confirmation_request`, `tool_approved`, `tool_denied`, `tool_impact_analysis`, `tool_execution_start`, `tool_audit_log`, `emergency_stop`

### Model Compatibility
- GPT-5 steering parameters (`reasoning.effort`, `text.verbosity`) only for `gpt-5*` models
- Fall back gracefully for older models that don't support advanced features
- Test with `gpt-5-mini` for reliable Responses API compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Empty responses**: Check `content.type === 'output_text'` extraction logic
2. **Function call failures**: Verify `item.arguments` vs `item.input` usage
3. **Duplicate call_id errors**: Don't include `response.output` in follow-up requests
4. **Model parameter errors**: Only send GPT-5 parameters to supported models
5. **Memory issues**: Check conversation cleanup settings and batch size configuration
6. **Token counting errors**: Verify tiktoken encoder initialization for the target model
7. **Compression failures**: Check OpenAI API connectivity and fallback to truncation strategy
8. **Race conditions**: Ensure conversation locking is enabled in production environment
9. **Tool confirmation timeouts**: Check `DEEP_TOOL_CONFIRMATION_TIMEOUT_MS` setting
10. **Tool execution failures**: Review audit trail and check emergency stop status
11. **Permission errors**: Verify tool risk assessment and approval workflows

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Enable detailed logging
OPENAI_LOG_PATHS=true npm run dev ask "test question"

# Test specific model
npm run dev ask "test" --model gpt-5-mini

# Check configuration
npm run dev config
```
