| { type: 'tool_approved'; data: { callId: string; approvalSource: 'user' | 'auto' | 'policy' } }
| { type: 'tool_denied'; data: { callId: string; reason: string } }
| { type: 'tool_impact_analysis'; data: { callId: string; analysis: ToolImpactAnalysis } }
| { type: 'tool_execution_start'; data: { callId: string; context: ToolExecutionContext } }
| { type: 'tool_audit_log'; data: { entry: ToolAuditEntry } }
| { type: 'emergency_stop'; data: { reason: string; affectedTools: string[] } }
```
