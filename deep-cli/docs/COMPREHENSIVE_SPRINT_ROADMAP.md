# Deep-CLI Comprehensive Sprint Plan Roadmap
## Building a Production-Ready Agentic Coding System

### Executive Summary

This roadmap transforms Deep-CLI from its current solid foundation into a production-ready, enterprise-grade agentic coding system. Drawing architectural insights from Gemini-CLI's mature patterns while maintaining our OpenAI Responses API foundation, we'll build a systematic development plan across 8 sprints (16 weeks) to achieve "ultrathink" agent capabilities.
